MORTALITY-ADJUSTED RETURNS:
• Annuity A: {irr_a:.2f}% (accounts for mortality after guarantee)
• Annuity B: {irr_b:.2f}% (fixed term, mortality irrelevant)
• Annuity C: {irr_c:.2f}% (fixed term, mortality irrelevant)

WHY ANNUITY A'S IRR IS LOWER:
• After year 15, payments are probability-weighted
• 72% chance of being alive at age 80
• 48% chance of being alive at age 85
• 20% chance of being alive at age 90

REAL-WORLD INTERPRETATION:
• Annuity A provides INSURANCE against longevity risk
• The "cost" of this insurance is the IRR difference
• Insurance premium = {irr_b - irr_a:.2f}% per year
• In exchange, you get lifetime income protection

WHICH IS BETTER?
• For EXPECTED outcome: Annuity B has higher IRR
• For RISK MANAGEMENT: Annuity A protects against living long
• The simulation chose A because it values the tail risk protection
